#Intro

It was a long hard road but we made it in the end!

Looking for Scrim is my final project of my WDI course and it is a team forming platform for competitive MOBA game League of Legends (link). Players don't have a dedicated platform and use LoL's forums in order to find more players.

Looking for Scrim (LFS) is built using Ruby on Rails and AngularJS and has data models with complex relationships.

#Features

The homepage features a carousel with brief titles of what this website can be used for.

The user needs to register and log in in order to read or post ads and they are able to comment on other users' ads. Users are able to edit and delete ads.

#Styling

The project's styling is based on LoL's rank progression (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc) and I have used art and fonts from the game client itself so that it reflects perfectly on the brand.

I used Bootstrap once again due to lack of time! I believe I may have become a master at manipulating it! The homepage carousel used is Slick.

#Challenges

This is the only WDI project I failed to deploy on Heroku but I endeavour to have a deeper look into what is wrong soon!

There are a couple of styling "features" that need attending to and a few functionality bugs, the most prominent being that the user cannot access their account page and that the hamburger menu appears open when resized to mobile.

The main challenge was definitely time once again and having been ill and absent for one day set me back a lot more than anticipated.

Authentication was a challenge since for some reason the token was not read as it should but along with my instructors we managed to overcome it successfully!

#Future possible additions

An API to check and import player stats, rank and match ratings.

#Easter Eggs

In order to display the website's functionality I chose to use characters from the popular TV Series House of Cards (note that this was made before the Kevin Spacey scandal). Please enjoy some of the comments if you're familiar with the show!
